## [Unreleased]

## [v0.1.0-beta] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Shared preprocessing pipeline: FastQC, Trim Galore, Bowtie2 alignment, MAPQ
  filtering, Picard duplicate handling, flagstat, idxstats, BigWig generation
- ChIP-seq / CUT&Tag assay-aware MACS3 peak calling with configurable parameters
- Optional control support via external BAM or FASTQ-based control sample rows
- Single-sample QC: FRiP, library complexity (Picard + NRF/PBC), MACS3 FE/ppois
  bedGraph signal tracks, per-sample QC summaries, and project-level aggregation
- Replicate-aware experiment model with technical replicate merging, biological
  replicate BAMs, and pooled treatment/control outputs
- TF ChIP-seq IDR: true-replicate IDR, pseudoreplicate-based self-IDR and
  pooled-IDR, reproducibility metrics, conservative/optimal peak sets
- Histone pooled QC summaries with target classification and peak-mode
  compatibility status
- CUT&Tag fragment-size QC and optional SEACR sidecar peak calling
- Configurable tool parameters for MACS3, bamCoverage, and IDR
- Schema-based config and sample sheet validation
- 7 test profiles covering major SE/PE/control/SEACR/IDR dispatch paths
- Tiny real-execution smoke test with synthetic data (no binary fixtures)
- GitHub Actions CI: fast validation + dry-run on PR/push, full execution on
  manual dispatch
- Streamlined environment setup with a full bioinformatics runtime environment
  and a lightweight CI environment
- Release checklist in README Developer Notes

### Documentation
- README with quick start, sample sheet reference, configuration guide,
  output structure, limitations, and developer notes
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md with full roadmap and current status
- Design specs and implementation plans under docs/superpowers/

### Known limitations
- Cross-correlation metrics (NSC/RSC) not yet implemented
- FE/ppois BigWig conversion not yet implemented
- IDR requires exactly 2 treatment biological replicates (no 3+ selection)
- CUT&Tag and broad-peak IDR not yet supported
- No bundled real public dataset
- ATAC-seq not supported

See README Limitations and KNOWN_ISSUES.md for full details.
